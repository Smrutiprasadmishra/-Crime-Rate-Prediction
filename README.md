# -Crime-Rate-Prediction
The Crime Rate Prediction project uses ML and Geospatial Visualization to analyze crime patterns, predict risks, and aid law enforcement in proactive crime prevention. 

✅ Crime Risk Prediction API: Built using Flask, allowing users to send location and time data to receive crime risk predictions.
✅ Machine Learning Model: Uses a Random Forest Regressor trained on historical crime data to predict crime risk scores.
✅ Interactive Dashboard: Developed with Streamlit, enabling users to enter location coordinates, time details, and get real-time crime risk predictions.
✅ Crime Heatmap Visualization: Utilizes Folium & Streamlit-Folium to create an interactive heatmap displaying crime hotspots.
✅ Dataset Preprocessing & Model Training: Data is cleaned, processed, and trained using Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for optimal model performance.
✅ REST API Integration: The Flask API allows seamless integration with other applications and supports real-time crime analysis.
✅ File Handling for Data Persistence: Ensures that trained models and datasets are stored efficiently for reuse.

Technology Stack:
🔹 Programming Language: Python
🔹 Web Frameworks: Flask, Streamlit
🔹 Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor)
🔹 Data Handling & Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Folium, Matplotlib, Streamlit-Folium
🔹 Model Deployment & API: Joblib, Requests

Use Case & Impact:
🚔 For Law Enforcement: Helps authorities deploy resources efficiently by identifying high-risk areas.
🏙️ For Urban Planners: Aids in designing safer cities by analyzing crime-prone locations.
📌 For Citizens: Allows individuals to check crime risk in specific areas for personal safety.

This project demonstrates how ML and data visualization can be effectively combined to predict and analyze crime trends, contributing to smarter and safer cities. 🚀
